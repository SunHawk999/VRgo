# VRgo
Go in virtual reality! Powered by A-frame.
Barer than bare bones at the moment. Completly front end stuff only atm, need to work on back end later.
Was mostly made to learn how aframe works and see what can be done with it...
So far this has been built on a linux machine, haven't tested with other os's yet.
