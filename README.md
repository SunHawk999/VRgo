# VRgo
Go in virtual reality! Powered by A-frame.
Barer than bare bones at the moment. Completly front end stuff only atm, need to work on back end later.
Was mostly made to learn how aframe works and see what can be done with it...

## Starting
Need to remember how this was used, what servers, etc. Should be some page on A-frame that has the listed sever to selfhost on...
